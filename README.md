# Azure IoT Workshop: NodeMCU Lab
IoT Workshop Lab using the NodeMCU (ESP8266) board.

This serves as a working document for the Azure Internet of Things Workshop in which the NodeMCU (ESP8266) Arduino compatible prototyping board is used to connect to Azure IoT.

## Activity Summary

In this lab, we'll walk through the basics of: 
* Creating and configuring an Azure IoT Hub
* Configuring a sample Arduino sketch to communicate with Azure IoT Hub
* Deploying the sketch to the NodeMCU device
* Monitoring the data received from the NodeMCU
* Visualizing and analyzing the IoT data in PowerBI

## Requirements
The following components are required to follow this lab in its entirety.  

### Hardware
**Note**: If you have some experience with prototyping boards and developing Arduino sketches, you can substitute many of the sensors and components in this guide and achieve the same general output. This is the power of Azure IoT Hub - device agnostic support through standards based protocols like AMQP, MQTT, and HTTPS. That being said, the lab is written for use with the following hardware:

* [NodeMCU (v1.0)](http://amzn.to/2qTRR2F)
* [Grove Base Shield for NodeMCU](http://amzn.to/2qTtH7E) (or from [Mouser](http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Seeed-Studio/105020008/))
* Sensors: 
  * [Temperature/Humidity Sensor](http://amzn.to/2psBJnC) (or from [Mouser](http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Seeed-Studio/101020074/))
  * [Vibration Sensor](http://amzn.to/2qTDpqN) (or from [Mouser](http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Seeed-Studio/101020054/))
  * [LED Multicolor](http://amzn.to/2qTHSdP) (or from [Mouser](http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Seeed-Studio/104030014/))
  * [Button](http://amzn.to/2pZvedb) (or from [Mouser](http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Seeed-Studio/101020003/))
  * [Grove cables](http://amzn.to/2pUQ2Es) (or from [Mouser](http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Seeed-Studio/110990027))

### Software
Similar to the hardware, if you have a preferred Arduino / ESP8266 IDE, you may be able to use an alternative development environment to achieve the goals of this lab, but the instructions are designed with the following in mind:

* [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
  * [Windows Installer](https://downloads.arduino.cc/arduino-1.8.2-windows.exe)
  * [Windows Zip for non-admin install](https://downloads.arduino.cc/arduino-1.8.2-windows.zip)
  * [Windows Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/arduino-ide/9nblggh4rsd8)
* ESP8266 Board Package (for Arduino IDE)
* CP210x Driver (if it's not already installed on your system)

## Software Installation

### Install the Arduino IDE
1. Download the [Windows Installer](https://downloads.arduino.cc/arduino-1.8.2-windows.exe)
1. Run the `arduino-1.8.2-windows.exe`  
1. Leave the default options selected to install the IDE and supporting drivers
![Installation Options](/images/software_install/arduino-windows_install_options.png)
1. Leave the default installation Destination Folder unchanged and select `Install`  
![Installation Folder](/images/software_install/arduino-windows_install_folder.png)
1. Wait for the installation to complete. Toward the end of the installation, you may be prompted to install several drivers. Select `Install` for each prompt.  
    * Adafruit Ports  
    * Arduino USB Driver (from Arduino srl)  
    * Arduino USB Driver (from Arduino LLC)

![Arduino File Preferences](/images/software_configuration/Arduino_File_Preferences.png)
1. Find the `Aditional Boards Manager URLs` and enter the following:
`http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json`  
**Note**: If you already use the Arduino IDE and already have a URL in this field, you can also click the small box to the right of the field to open a larger window to enter the ESP8266 package on a new line.

1. Click `OK` to close the Preference Screen
1. Open the menu: `Tools` → `Board` → `Boards Manager`  
![Arduino File Preferences](/images/software_configuration/Arduino_Boards_Manager.png)  
**Note**: If this is your first time running the Boards Manager, you may have to wait a moment while it downloads the packages.
1. Type `ESP8266` in the search box at the top of the Boards Manager screen
1. Click the `esp8266` record to select the row then select `Install` to install the package.
